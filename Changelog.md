# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Wayvue** project will be documented in this file.







## [v1.4.1] - 2026-02-10
### Fixed
- **Deep Linking**: Fixed rental car deep links for partner sites.
    - **Kayak**: Improved URL format to include specific pickup times (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHh`), preventing "past time" errors.
    - **Expedia**: Temporarily disabled Expedia deep links due to partner API restrictions preventing direct search queries.
- **Data Privacy**: Enhanced address parsing to aggressively strip zip codes from location strings, ensuring only "City, State" is passed to external partners for better privacy and search accuracy.
- **UI Improvements**: Hidden placeholder prices in rental recommendation cards to avoid displaying inaccurate estimates.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-02-10
### Added
- **Community Trip Intelligence**: New sidebar feature displaying live active user counts, top trending destinations, and accumulated "Safe Miles" generated by the community.
- **Backend API**: Added `/api/community-stats` endpoint to serve aggregated real-time usage data.
- **Analytics**: Enhanced `trip_generated` event logging to include distance for accurate community mileage tracking.
- **Dashboard Restructuring**: Completely reorganized the Admin Dashboard into 4 strategic sections: Platform Overview, Geography & Devices, Engagement, and System Performance.
- **New Metrics**:
    - **Platform**: Total Events, Avg Session, Retention, Error Rate.
    - **Geography**: Top Cities, Top Routes, Device Breakdown.
    - **Engagement**: Conversion Rates, Route Preference (Scenic vs. Fastest).
    - **System**: Frontend Page Load & Backend API Latency with historical comparisons.
- **Visual Overhaul**: Improved UI with a tabbed layout, new icons, and refined metric cards.

### Added
- **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Implemented a "System Performance" section in the Admin Dashboard featuring real-time charts for Frontend Page Load Time and Backend API Latency.
- **Performance Averages**: Added support for Today, 7-Day, and Overall average metrics display for system performance monitoring.
- **Data Sanity Guardrails**: Implemented algorithmic filtering to exclude outlier performance data (absurdly high values), ensuring accurate trend visualization.
- **Engagement Monitoring**: Integrated average session duration and improved retention metrics in the Platform Overview.

### Changed
- **Unit Conversion**: Standardized performance metrics across the platform to display in **seconds (s)** instead of milliseconds, enhancing readability for non-technical users.
- **Admin UI Polish**: Redesigned the "Exit" button with a high-visibility red-outline style and clarified labeling to "Exit Dashboard".

### Fixed
- **Metric Key Mismatch**: Resolved a critical tracking bug where the dashboard was filtering for `page_load` instead of the correctly logged `page_load_time`.
- **Top Destinations**: Fixed a logic error that occasionally displayed "undefined" in the regional popularity list by improving coordinate-to-city resolution.
- **Chart Interaction**: Fixed a bug where hover tooltips on Recharts components were partially obscured by card glass-morphism effects.

### Fixed
- **Instant Route Switching**: Resolved a bug where switching between "Fastest" and "Scenic" routes caused a full page reload. It now correctly uses cached route variants for instant switching on both One-Way and Round Trip journeys.
- **Round Trip Support**: Fixed logic in `App.tsx` where round-trip variant caching was being ignored, causing unnecessary re-fetches.
- **Place Names**: Updated the backend to use robust reverse geocoding for all route points (Weather and Road Conditions), effectively replacing generic "Mile X" / "Segment X" placeholders with real City and State names.
- **Trip Header Buttons**: Fixed an issue where the "Start Trip" and "Return Trip" toggle buttons were unclickable due to z-index layering issues.
- **UI Styling**: Refined the styling of "Round Trip" and "Update Path" buttons in the header to prevent text wrapping and improve visual consistency.

## [v1.2.13] - 2026-02-04
### Fixed
- **Trip Header Layout**: Refactored the Trip Header using a CSS Grid system to prevent "Scenic/Fast" toggles from overlapping with "Start/Return" trip buttons on desktop.
- **Round Trip UI**: Fixed a logic issue where "Start and Return" buttons wouldn't appear if internal return data was partially structured. Added a fallback to the `isRoundTrip` state flag.

## [v1.2.12] - 2026-02-04
### Added
- **Range Rover Discovery Icon**: Upgraded the moving car marker to a high-fidelity SVG resembling a Range Rover Discovery with panoramic roof, roof rails, and detailed lighting.
- **Physics-Based Animation**: Implemented advanced interpolation logic for the car animation.
    - **Smoothing**: Dampened rotation to eliminate "tumbling" and added a "lookahead" feature (50m) to smooth out micro-jitters in the route data.
    - **Pacing**: Slowed down the animation loop (25s) for a more realistic "cruising" feel.
    - **Lookahead**: Implemented a 50m lookahead for bearing calculations, ensuring the car steers towards the road ahead rather than reacting to immediate zig-zags.

## [v1.2.11] - 2026-02-04
### Changed
- **Instant Route Switching**: Switching between "Fastest" and "Scenic" routes is now instant and no longer triggers a loading screen when the location hasn't changed.
- **Route Icons**: Updated the route preference icons to a **Camera** (Scenic) and **Zap** (Fastest), matching the Trip View design, and added tooltips.
- **Favicon**: Updated the browser tab icon to a custom SVG with a dark background for better visibility, replacing the standard transparent icon.

### Added
- **Route Update Feedback**: Added a contextual "Updating your journey" loading screen with animation for legitimate route changes (e.g., changing date or destination).

### Fixed
- **Toggle Button Layout**: Fixed CSS styling issues that caused misalignment and invalid spacing in the route preference toggle buttons.
## [v1.2.10] - 2026-02-03
### Fixed
- **Input Icon Overlap**: Added right padding to the start location input to prevent long text (e.g., "New York, NY") from overlapping with the "Current Location" icon.

## [v1.2.9] - 2026-02-03
### Changed
- **Empty State Copy**: Updated the main heading from "Where to today?" to "Plan your escape." to better align with the target audience.

## [v1.2.8] - 2026-02-03
### Added
- **Extended Trip Header Metrics**: Restored the display of Gas Price (Fuel), Electric Price (EV), and Alert counts in the trip view header.
- **Responsive Metrics Bar**: Implemented a scrollable container for header metrics on mobile, ensuring all data (Time, Dist, Fuel, EV, Alerts) fits without breaking layout.

### Fixed
- **Mobile Icon Visibility**: Addressed an issue where the central navigation icon was hidden on mobile due to the new taller header. Applied specific responsive spacing (`pt-[400px]` on mobile) to ensure the icon is visible below the search box, while strictly correctly maintaining the standard layout on laptop/desktop screens.

### Changed
- **Mobile Header Layout**: Refactored the top navigation bar for mobile devices. The "Search Locations" input bar is now placed on its own row below the logo and controls, ensuring it is always perfectly centered and has ample space for input. Desktop layout remains a single unified row.

### Fixed
- **Mobile Home Screen Layout**: Fixed an issue where the central "Navigation Compass" icon was hidden behind the input bar on mobile devices. Added responsive spacing to ensure the "Where to today?" section and its icon are fully visible and centered below the controls.

### Added
- **Current Location Button**: Added a "Locate Me" button (crosshair icon) to the Start Location input on mobile. This addresses user feedback about missing navigation functionality, allowing users to quickly fill their current location.

### Fixed
- **Calculation Error Handling**: Resolved an issue where invalid start/end locations or API failures would cause the app to silently reset to the home screen. Added clear error messages to the inputs bar to guide the user (e.g., "Please enter both a start and destination").

### Fixed
- **Tablet Layout**: Fixed an issue where the results panel on iPad/Tablet was constrained to a small width (`max-w-md`), leaving empty space. It now fills the full width in the stacked layout.

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-02-03
### Fixed
- **Mobile Logo Visibility**: Unhidden the "Wayvue" logo text on mobile screens (removed `hidden sm:block`).
- **Trip Header Overlap**: Refactored `TripHeader` to stack controls vertically on mobile screens preventing overlap of Price/Unit toggle and Route information.
- **AI Summary Layout**: Moved **Wayvue Intelligence** to the top of the Overview tab (immediately after Safety Score) ensuring critical insights are visible without scrolling.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-02-03
### Added
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Complete overhaul of the mobile experience.
    - **Responsive Layout**: `TripViewLayout` now stacks the map (45%) and results panel (55%) on small screens.
    - **Bottom Sheet Interaction**: Added a "drag handle" visual and rounded corners to the mobile results panel for a native app feel.
    - **Collapsible Inputs**: The home screen input ribbon is now collapsible and streamlined for mobile, prioritizing Start/End locations.
- **Enhanced Trip Header**: Added start/end scrolling masks and larger touch targets for unit toggles on mobile.
- **Cache Management**: Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.firebase` cache files.

### Changed
- **Loading Experience**: Replaced the generic spinner with a custom **Travel-Themed Loading Animation** (cycling icons: Car, Tent, Mountain, etc.) and dynamic status messages (e.g., "Packing the car...", "Checking weather...").

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-02-02
### Added
- **Smart Schedule**: UI polish for the "Smart Schedule" card, including clearer "Safety" and "Traffic" labels and dynamic badges.
- **Suggested Stops**: Redesigned the "Suggested Stops" section with category-specific colors (Food, Gas, etc.) and a horizontal scrollable filter list.
- **ETA & Distance**: Added ETA and cumulative distance indicators to Weather Cards in the Forecast tab.
- **Quick Route Edit**: Implemented a popover for quickly editing the route (Start/End) directly from the Trip Header.

### Fixed
- **Weather N/A Bug**: Fixed an issue where map markers displayed "N/A" for temperature by implementing a gap-filling strategy (interpolating nearest valid weather data).
- **Date Handling**: Corrected date logic for overnight trips to ensuring weather queries match the actual arrival day.
- **Deployment**: Resolved 500 errors by synchronizing server-side logic with Firebase Cloud Functions.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-02-01
### Added
- **Initial Release**: Core "Wayvue" trip intelligence features.
- **AI Analysis**: Implementation of `WayvueAI` for generating trip safety scores and insights.
- **Real-time Weather**: Integration with Open-Meteo for route-based weather forecasting.
- **Places Search**: Functionality to find stops (Gas, Food, EV Charging) along the route.
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive map with route polyline, weather markers, and traffic layers.
- **Project Structure**: Setup of Client (Vite/React), Server (Express), and Firebase configuration.
